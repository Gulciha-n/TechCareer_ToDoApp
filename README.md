# TodoApp

This project is a simple todo list application. Users can list, update, delete, and search for tasks.

## Technologies Used

- **Kotlin:** Used as the primary programming language for the application.
- **ViewModel:** Used to manage UI data. Acts as an intermediary between the UI and the data, ensuring that the data is displayed correctly.
- **LiveData:** Automatically updates certain parts of the application using the Observer design pattern.
- **Room Database:** Used for database operations.
- **Navigation Component:** Used for in-app navigation and fragment management.
- **Hilt:** Used for dependency injection. Manages and injects dependencies used throughout the application.
- **MVVM:** Model-View-ViewModel architecture is used. This architecture ensures a clear separation between database operations (Model), user interface (View), and business logic (ViewModel).
